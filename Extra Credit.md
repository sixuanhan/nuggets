## Extra Credit 

### Our additions

#### a range limit on vision

We set a range limit on vision of a diameter of five spots. To clarify, the players can still know the spots that they have seen, but they cannot see occupants farther than five spots away from them anymore.


#### stealing gold

We allow players to steal gold from other players by stepping onto them. We steal 20 nuggets from the other player if they have 20 nugget; otherwise we steal all of their nuggets.
